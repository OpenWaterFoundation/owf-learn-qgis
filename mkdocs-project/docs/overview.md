# Learn QGIS / Overview #

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are used to manage, manipulate, display, and publish spatial data.
GIS software can be complex due to the need to handle multiple data formats for spatial data,
project two and three-dimensional coordinates into a flat space for visualization,
handle vector and raster data, and other complexities.

Despite the complexities of GIS, many tasks benefit from using spatial data,
in its simplest form as maps that provide spatial reference for real-world features such as rivers
and data collection points.
Consequently, there is a need to utilize GIS software tools as efficiently as possible for simple tasks,
and QGIS can meet this need.

The Open Water Foundation recommends using QGIS for the following purposes,
in increasing order of complexity:

* Create maps to visualize spatial data layers.
* Test that spatial data formats that are being produced by other software tools is accurate.
* Convert spatial data from one format to another.
* Automate spatial data analysis and data format conversion, using GDAL, OGR, and Python tools.
* Create integrated spatial data analysis and visualization tools.

The remainder of this documentation describes how to install QGIS software, configure a map to view spatial data layers,
and process spatial data.
