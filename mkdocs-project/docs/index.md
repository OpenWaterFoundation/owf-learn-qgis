# Open Water Foundation / Learn QGIS #

This documentation provides resources to learn how to use the [Quantum GIS (QGIS)](http://www.qgis.org) software.
QGIS is free and open source [Geographic Information System (GIS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system) software.
QGIS is an alternative to the commercial [Esri ArcGIS software](https://www.arcgis.com),
in particular for individuals and organizations that cannot afford the cost of ArcGIS software
and/or may only infrequently use GIS tools.
Both QGIS and ArcGIS offer desktop versions and integrate with web components.

This documentation has been written based on experience using QGIS at the Open Water Foundation (OWF),
with focus on tasks that are useful in water resources and solutions.
This documentation focuses on the QGIS desktop software,
although web technologies and data standards may be used to consume and publish data.
