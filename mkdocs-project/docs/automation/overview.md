# Automating Processing / Overview #

QGIS Desktop and other interactive GIS tools, such as ArcGIS Desktop and
interactive web mapping tools,
are great for interactive data manipulation.
However, using this approach for large amounts of data or repeated tasks is
not cost-effective, can result in quality issues, and is not the best use of people's time.

Many tasks can be automated, as described in the following sections:

* [QGIS Processing](#qgis-processing)
* [Open Water Foundation GeoProcessor](#open-water-foundation-geoprocessor)

-----------------------

## QGIS Processing ##

QGIS Desktop provides tools to automate processing:

* Use the ***Processing*** menu.
* See: [Automating Complex Workflows using Processing Modeler](http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/processing_graphical_modeler.html).

## Open Water Foundation GeoProcessor ##

The Open Water Foundation is developing an open source GeoProcessor application
to automate geospatial processing.
This software leverages QGIS pyQGIS Python modules and provides a flexible
workflow command language.

* See: [OWF GeoProcessor](http://learn.openwaterfoundation.org/owf-app-geoprocessor-python-doc-user/).
* See: [OWF GeoProcessor Tests (useful examples)](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-app-geoprocessor-python-test)
