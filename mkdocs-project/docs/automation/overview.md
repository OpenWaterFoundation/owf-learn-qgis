# QGIS / Automating Processing / Overview #

QGIS Desktop and other interactive GIS tools, such as ArcGIS Pro and
interactive web mapping tools,
are great for interactive data viewing and manipulation.
However, using this approach for large amounts of data or repeated tasks is
not efficient and can result in quality issues.

Many tasks can be automated, as described in the following sections:

* [QGIS Processing](#qgis-processing)
* [Open Water Foundation GeoProcessor](#open-water-foundation-geoprocessor)

-----------------------

## QGIS Processing ##

QGIS Desktop provides tools to automate processing:

* Use the ***Processing*** menu.
* See: [Automating Complex Workflows using Processing Modeler](http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/processing_graphical_modeler.html) - written for QGIS 2.

## Open Water Foundation GeoProcessor ##

The Open Water Foundation is developing an open source GeoProcessor application
to automate geospatial processing.
This software leverages QGIS pyQGIS Python modules and provides a flexible
workflow command language.

* See: [OWF GeoProcessor](http://learn.openwaterfoundation.org/owf-app-geoprocessor-python-doc-user/).
